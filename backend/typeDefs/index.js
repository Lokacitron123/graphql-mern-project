// Why merge type definitions? ðŸ˜€

// Modularity: Merging type definitions allow you to keep related schema components in seperate files, promoting modularity and organization.

// Easier Collaboration: If multiple developers are working on different parts of the schema, merging seperate type definitions can make it easier to collaborate without conflicts.

// Reuse: You can reuse type definitions across different parts of the schema, potentially reducing duplication.

// Clear Seperation of Concerns: Each file can focus on a specific domain or type of date, making it easier to understand and maintain.
